# CS7290 Causal Modeling in Machine Learning: Homework 1

For this assignment, you get your build a generative model with `bnlearn` and with `pyro`. Check out the [*bnlearn* docs](http://www.bnlearn.com) and the [*pyro* docs](http://pyro.ai) if you have questions about these packages.

## Submission guidelines

Use a Jupyter notebook and/or R Markdown file to combine code and text answers.  Compile your solution to a static PDF document(s).  Submit both the compiled PDF and source files.  The TA's will recompile your solutions, and a failing grade will be assigned if the document fails to recompile due to bugs in the code.  If you use [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook), send the link as well as downloaded PDF and source files.

## Background

Recall the [survey data](survey.txt) discussed in the lecture. 

* **Age (A):** It is recorded as *young* (**young**) for individuals below 30 years, *adult* (**adult**) for individuals between 30 and 60 years old, and *old* (**old**) for people older than 60.
* **Sex (S):** The biological sex of individual, recorded as *male* (**M**) or *female* (**F**).
* **Education (E):** The highest level of education or training completed by the individual, recorded either *high school* (**high**) or *university degree* (**uni**).
* **Occupation (O):** It is recorded as an *employee* (**emp**) or a *self employed* (**self**) worker.
* **Residence (R):** The size of the city the individual lives in, recorded as *small* (**small**) or *big* (**big**).
* **Travel (T):** The means of transport favoured by the individual, recorded as *car* (**car**), *train* (**train**) or *other* (**other**)

Travel is the *target* of the survey, the quantity of interest whose behavior is under investigation.

We use the following directed acyclic graph (DAG) as our basis for building a model of the process that generated this data.

## 1 Building a DAG

A DAG maps to a factorization of the joint distribution (e.g., $P(A, B, C) == P(A)P(B|A)P(C|B)$).  In *bnlearn*, you can use the function `modelstring(dag)` to convert a DAG into a string representation of a factorization of the joint probability distribution. We can go from a string representation to a DAG using the function `model2network(string)`.

* Write out the factorization of the joint distribution implied by the DAG using mathematical notation
* Rewrite the above factorization in *bnlearn*'s string representation.
* Use this to create a DAG in *bnlearn*.
* Print the class of the DAG object.
* Use `graphviz.plot` to plot the DAG.

## 2 Experimenting with graph utilities

* Extract and print the nodes and arcs of the DAG you created in previous questions.
* Extract and print the parents and the children of each node using `parents` and `children` functions.
* Use the `mb` function to extract the Markov blanket of A, E, and T.
* Describe, in terms of the joint probability distribution and NOT in terms of the DAG the definition of a Markov blanket.
* How do you identify the Markov blanket from the DAG?

## 3 Conditional probability distribution (CPD) parameter estimation

Bayesian network = DAG + CPD with specified parameters

* Fit the parameters of the DAG from the data stored in survey.txt using Bayesian estimation, and save the result into an object of class bn.fit.  
* Play with the Bayesian prior parameter **iss** and report the changes in the parameters learned from Bayesian network. Explain the changes.

## 4 Graph manipulation

* Create a copy of the DAG (e.g. `dag2 <- dag`).  Remove the arc from Education to Occupation, and plot the result with `graphviz.plot`.
* Fit the parameters of the modified network. Which local distributions change, and how?

## 5 Markov equivalence

* Compute and plot the PDAG of the DAG for the survey data using the `cpdag` function.  Call this PDAG P1 and the original DAG D1.  How does P1 and D1 compare?  Explain any similarities or differences.
* Create a DAG D2 that is the same as D1 except that it has a new arc from Occupation to Residence.  This makes sense because surely somebody's job determines where they live (or is it the other way around?).  Note that this is a fine example of applying domain knowledge about the data generative process in causal model development. Plot the result with `graphviz.plot`.
* Now recompute a PDAG P2 from D2.  What, if anything, is different between P1 and P2 and what explains these differences or lack of differences?
* Create a third DAG D3 that is different from the second DAG (with the O->R edge) but is in the same Markov equivalence class. Do this by reasoning about P2 -- in other words look at P2 and create another DAG D3, such that `cpdag(D3)` will also produce P2.  Plot D3.
* Calculate the log-likelihood of the data given D2 and the log-likelihood of the data given D3.  These values should be the same, explain why.  You can use the `score` function with the argument `type = 'loglik`, or you can simply se the `logLik` function, which is just a wrapper for `score`.  You don't need to provide paramter values for the CPDs of the DAG, `score` will estimate them for you.

## 6 Switching to Pyro

If you are new to tensor-based frameworks, make sure you give yourself plenty of time for this question.  It takes time to get used to debugging.  One common source of bugs is integers, *pyro* prefers you use floats (e.g., `torch.tensor(1.0)` instead of `torch.tensor(1)`).  If you hit a bug and solve it, why not share with your classmates on Piazza?

* Use *pyro* to reimplement the Bayesian network with parameter values you fitted in question 3.  Use default *iss* values and round parameter estimates to 2 decimal places.  Show source code.
* You observe a self-employed person who lives in a big city.  Answer the following inference questions using `pyro.condition` and (if needed) a *pyro* inference algorithm.
    1. What is your prediction of this person's means of travel.  Provide either a MAP estimate or a histogram of the marginal on the variable "T". Hint: an inference algorithm will work here but you don't actually need it, you could just use Monte Carlo sampling)?
    2. What is your prediction of this person's age?  Provide either a MAP estimate or a histogram of the marginal on the variable "A".  Hint: make use of the fact that the variables here are discrete.  Check out the docs for [discrete inference](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/inference_algos.html#module-pyro.infer.discrete) and for [importance sampling](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/inference_algos.html#module-pyro.infer.importance).
