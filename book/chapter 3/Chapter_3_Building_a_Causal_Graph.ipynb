For example, we can use the inference algorithms such as [variable elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination) to infer any conditional and marginal probability of interest. These algorithms more or less just \"work\" without our having to understand their mechanics. This contrasts with more free-form probabilistic ML libraries such as Pyro, where we typically have to write the inference procedure explicitly."

        "\n",
        "Some approaches to causal inference avoid specifying a causal DAG in favor of specifying the variables according to their role in a causal inference query. For example, in a causal effect inference query, a variable could be a \"treatment\" or \"effect\" or \"instrumental variable\" or \"confounder\" or a \"mediator\". But we can see this approach as merely another way of specifying a causal DAG. We can see this with the library DoWhy, which allows us to specify a model in terms of these roles. Once we do that, we can extract and visualize the DAG."
