# Causal Modeling in Machine Learning Workshop Repository

This repository contains materials for a workshop on **Causal Modeling in Machine Learning**, focusing on intervention-based reasoning, causal inference algorithms, counterfactuals, and the integration of causal structure into modern ML systems.

## Contents

- [`workshop.md`](./workshop.md) – Description of the **Causal Modeling in Machine Learning** workshop, including schedule, learning objectives, and software tools.
- [`syllabus_NEU.md`](./syllabus_NEU.md) – A **graduate course syllabus** from Northeastern University covering causal modeling, do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, and causal ML applications.

## Usage

Use this repository to:

- Prepare or adapt the workshop for conferences, symposia, or internal trainings.
- Reference the graduate syllabus for a semester-long academic course on causal modeling.
- Build or extend materials on causal inference, causal ML, and counterfactual modeling in your own teaching or research practice.

All materials in this repository are open and reusable for educational and research purposes.
