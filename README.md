# Causal Modeling in Machine Learning Course Repository

This is the course repository for the [Causal Modeling in Machine Learning Track](https://www.altdeep.ai/p/causal-ml) on [Altdeep.ai](https://www.altdeep.ai).

Altdeep.ai courses are taught via online instruction paired with one-on-one meetings with course instructors.  [Visit Altdeep.ai](https://www.altdeep.ai) for info on the course content and fees.  The material in this repo is open source and free.

## Syllabi and Schedules

* [NEU Syllabus](https://github.com/robertness/causalML/blob/master/syllabus_NEU.md)

*NEU Students: If you are thinking of signing up for the course and have questions, reach out to me at robert@altdeep.ai, rather than my NEU email.*

## Course Outcomes

Upon completing this course, you will be capable of building causal reasoning algorithms into decision-making systems in data science and machine learning teams within top-tier technology organizations.  You will have implemented a portfolio project that demonstrates this competence.  You will use the PyTorch-based probabilistic deep learning framework [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/) to implement the homework assignments and class project and will be an expert in using this framework by the end of the course.

## Who is this course for?

You will gain the most from this course if you:

* You are familiar with random variables, joint probability distributions, conditional probabilities distributions, Baye's rule and basic ideas from Bayesian statistics, and expectation.
* You a good software engineer or aspire to be one.
* You work in or plan to work on a team running experiments in a top-tier tech company or a technically advanced retail company.
* You plan on working as an ML/AI research scientist and want to learn how to create agents that reason like humans.

## Course Description

This course will cover the following:

1. Causality in the context of model-based machine learning, Bayesian modeling, and programmatic AI
1. Reasoning about probability distributions with directed acyclic graphs
1. Interventions and do-calculus, identification and estimation of causal effects, covariate adjustment, and other methods of causal inference
1. Counterfactual reasoning and algorithmic counterfactuals
1. Causal reasoning in the context of A/B tests, multi-armed bandits, sequential decision-making, and reinforcement learning
1. Deep causal latent variable models
