In this project we are responding to the causal questions: Model 1: Does Smoking Causes Cancer? Model 2: Is someone more prone to Smoke because of their Genetics? Model 3: Coughing Does not lead to more fatigue? Model 4: Does Lung Cancer Increase your chances of having a car accident?

We have used a Artificial dataset:

Dataset:
LUCAS (LUng CAncer Simple set) and LUCAP (LUng CAncer set with Probes) contain toy data generated artificially by causal Bayesian networks with binary variables. LUCAS and LUCAP are modeling a medical application for the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of lung cancer.

LUCAS0: Medical diagnosis We show the graph of the generating process of LUCAS0 in Figure 1. Each node represents a variable/feature and the arcs represent causal relationships. We number the variables from 0, where 0 is the target variable: Lung Cancer. The other variables are numbered in the order of the columns of the data tables of LUCAS: 1: Smoking 2: Yellow_Fingers 3: Anxiety 4: Peer_Pressure 5: Genetics 6: Attention_Disorder 7: Born_an_Even_Day 8: Car_Accident 9: Fatigue 10: Allergy 11: Coughing

we have exasimne the causal inference on the models by creating the model, identification, examination and refutation.
