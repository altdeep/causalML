    "\n",
    "The causal scene generation project involves generating 2D images from natural language where the causal model describes the relationship between the entities in the caption. Flickr8k dataset contains captions and the corresponding images. Using these captions, along with the causal model, we can probabilistically reason the following:\n",

    "In order to achieve this, we first need to model our real world concepts as entities so that we can translate them into object-oriented programming language. For example, in our cases we need to have classes for A girl and A boy (The Entities),  A building (The environment), and class for action (walking, running etc) for all the entities (Action).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been around since the 70s[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)].However, OOP is not prevalent in the probabilistic programming (PP) community. At the time of this writing, there is no OO probabilistic programming support in Python. In this tutorial, we attempt to model our domain entities as Python objects and then perform causal inference on them using Pyro.\n"

    "1. The classes are represented in the `rectangle` boxes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The notebook provides an example of object oriented probabilistic programming in pyro using an example of a social media which has classes defined for people, posts, connections and comments. Furthermore, it also shows a way to read in data from a knowledge base, here we are using sqlite. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key ideas introduced in this approach are:\n",
    "- Using unique ID's read from the knowledge base to create persistent trace objects accross model runs. \n",
    "- Creating observe and infer abstarct methods for each class to provide an interface to set value for a instance of an object and to infer a particular value for an instance\n",
    "- The idea of a Universe class (here it is SocialMedia) which contains the CPT's and provides and an interface between conditions on individual class instances and pyro's condition and intervention functions. "
