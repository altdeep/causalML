## Project Description

Football players' salaries have been one of the hot topics among football fans over the years. Our study was conducted to explore the factors that significantly influence the football players' salary. We explored factors like player's club tier, positions in a team, age, weight, height, international reputation score, potential score, and a consortium of performance statistics (ex. pace, dribbling, defending, attacking_crossing, attacking_finishing, attacking_heading_accuracy, ect.). Our data including all the salaries data of most football players from 2015 to 2019. The main goal of the study is explore the factors that influence salary of players and try to build a causal inference model for soccer club managers to leverage as a tool to evaluate player values.

From our intuition and after consulting friends who are super football funs, football players salary depends on several main factors: age, player's international reputation, club tier, positions, all the statistics which can represents the players' performances, players' demographic datas which including weight, height ect. We draw the DAG using 'pyplot' and 'networkx' package to show our assumptions of the causal effects
