We met more than 25 years ago and have lived in Boston ever since. We are both professionals (Kristina works in Higher-Ed and Chris runs an education technology company). We have lived in our 1868 Victorian for over 15 years and love our space in JP.

We have lived all over Boston but have always considered Jamaica Plain the best neighborhood in town... partly because it is a true neighborhood. Nowhere else in the city can you be 5-minutes from dense nature that obscures the hustle and bustle of urban life by Jamaica Pond or the Arboretum, while still being minutes from Fenway Park, Longwood medical center, and great restaurants!

We have two sons, 13 & 12, and we love to avail ourselves of the city and community we love. We coach baseball, basketball, and flag football, and love to explore, meet new people, and share what we know about Boston with anyone interested. 

For many years we hosted international students coming to Boston to study English and have hosted folks from Korea, Japan, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Kazakhstan. These former guests are now good friends and we enjoyed being their ambassadors to Boston.

My large family are / were all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months, we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor (schedule and availability permitting).

My large family are / were all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months, we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor (schedule and availability permitting).

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

My name is Chen, I live in Boston MA and work for a software company. I travel a lot and since discovering the Airbnb option more then 5 years ago I much more prefer to stay in the real houses/apartments then in the hotels. I believe that through the Airbnb experience you get to enjoy much more of the local atmosphere, having more of a unique experience and much better vibe and understanding about different local mentalities and cities.

We're Romo and Nayeli! A young and fun loving couple currently living and working in the great City of Boston.  

We're both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China before repatriating back to the U.S. Very long story.  We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle, and travel.  We are always thinking, planning or dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  Anywhere we travel, we usually seek the latest culinary experience, or are in search mode for that perfect cocktail anywhere we go.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is really an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always!
 
We both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing  in 2000, right after graduating from college.

Our paths crossed in China in 2010 - and in 2015 we tied the knot in Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we repatriate back to the US - and now call Boston home.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US - and even more so when we have the opportunity to live in this great city.

Look forward to hosting you soon!

The ""T"" is a block away, along with BlueBikes (bike share). And, there's always Uber, Lyft or Taxis.  ** INSIDER TIP: Many guests have raved about using the ""Logan Express"" bus to and from the airport. They recently added a stop very close to the apartment - about 1 block away at the Back Bay train station.  It's inexpensive (FREE from the airport and $3 to the airport) it runs every 20 minutes. Street parking is for South End residents with permits, there are some  Visitor parking spots scattered about, but they are hard to come by. Two garages offering rental parking are within a couple of blocks on Dartmouth St. Check out SpotHero, which often offer better pricing than paying at the garage.","The entire apartment with a full kitchen and private washer & dryer is exclusively for your enjoyment.
