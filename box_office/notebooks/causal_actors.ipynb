This is the Ignorability assumption: that the outcome is independent of treatment assignment (choice of actors), so now average difference in outcomes between two groups of actors can only be attributable to the treatment (actors). The problem here is that it's impossible to check if we've measured all confounders. So Yixin Wang and David M. Blei proposed an algorithm; “The Deconfounder” to sidestep the search for confounders because its impossible to exhaust them.\n",
