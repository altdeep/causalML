## Homework

The homework in this class will consist of 4 problem sets, which will combine mathematical derivations with programming exercises in Python.

The suggested homework deadlines are 

| Homework | Date Due     |
|----------|--------------|
| HW1      | June 27      |
| HW2      | July 4       |
| HW3      | August 8     |
| HW4      | August 22    |

## Project

The goal of the project is to gain experience in implementing a a method covered in the lectures and build their portfolio.

We will provide a list of suggested project desscriptions.  Students are encouraged to collaborate in groups of 2-4.  Students who want to pursue a unique project should speak to the instructor.  Unique projects done in collaboration with a company are encouraged.

See past-student projects in the projects directory to get an impression of what projects look like.

## Schedule

### **June 6, 2020**, **June 13, 2020**: Causality and Model-based Machine Learning

**Goal**: Graft on a high-level understanding of causality in the context of machine learning.

### How to speak graph, or *DAG* that's a nice model!

**Dates: June 20, June 27, 2020**

**Goal**: Directed Graphs provide a language for composing, communicating, reasoning about, and falsifying causal generative models, probability, and causality.  In this section, you will learn this language, and gain the ability to use graph algorithms to describe and reason about the data's probability distributions.   

### The Tao of Do; Modeling and Simulating Causal Interventions

**Dates: July 4 and 11, 2020**

**Goal**: Gain ability to build one's first causal generative machine learning model using a deep learning framework.

## Causal Inference; Identifying and Estimating Causal Effects

**Dates: July 18, July 25, August 1, 2020**

**Goal**: Assimilate the bread & butter of causal inference; identification, do-calculus, potential outcomes, common estimation techniques such as intrumental variables and propensity score matching.

## Algorithmic Counterfactuals

**Dates: August 8 and 15, 2020**

**Goal**: Gain ability to implement counterfactual reasoning algorithms in code.

## Causal Agent Models

**Dates: August 22 and 29, 2020**

**Goal**: Gain ability to create sequential decision-making algorithms using causal models in practice, and apply causal modeling ideas in reinforcement learning research.
